What is "Oregon Trail"?
  It is considered to be, possibly, the most popular educational video game in history. It was such a popular computer game that the term "Oregon Trail Generation" refers to an entire demographic of Westerners sandwiched between the end of Generation X and the beginning of the Millenial Generation who are characterized as having had "an analog childhood and a digital adulthood."  If this describes you, you might have been given the opportunity to play Oregon Trail on a school computer, in order to learn historical details about pioneer life in mid-1800s North America, or as a reward for good behavior.

Your task
We're not going to be re-creating every feature of Oregon Trail. But we will be using the game as inspiration for learning to build classes which interact with one another.
